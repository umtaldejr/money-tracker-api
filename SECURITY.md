- **Token Security**: Secure token generation and validation
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required permissions

### Data Protection

- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use strong encryption algorithms
- **Secure Data Storage**: Protect data at rest
- **Secure Data Transmission**: Protect data in transit
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary data
- **Secure Deletion**: Properly delete sensitive data

### Environment Security

- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for secrets
- **Secure Configuration**: Follow security configuration guidelines
- **Regular Updates**: Keep all components updated
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to production systems
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
